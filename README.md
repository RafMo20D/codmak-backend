## Overview 🌐

Utilizing a fine-tuned BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model in conjunction with QLORA (Quantization Low Rank Adaptation) for language model adaptation, this project aims at revolutionizing the way we recommend transportation modes. BERT, known for its deep learning prowess in understanding the contextual relationships between words in text, was meticulously fine-tuned on a specialized dataset. This dataset was designed to capture the nuanced preferences and requirements for various transportation modes, encompassing factors such as efficiency, cost, environmental impact, and user convenience.
The fine-tuning process was enhanced by employing QLORA, an advanced technique for adapting large language models like BERT. QLORA focuses on optimizing model size and inference speed without compromising the model's predictive accuracy. It achieves this by quantizing the model's parameters and applying low-rank matrix factorization, making the fine-tuned model more efficient and adaptable for real-time applications.
This combination of fine-tuned BERT and QLORA adaptation enables our system to analyze user queries with high precision, understanding the intricate details of each request. By processing natural language inputs, the system can recommend the most suitable transportation modes tailored to the user's specific needs and preferences. This method represents a significant leap forward in creating more intelligent, responsive, and personalized transportation recommendation systems, promising to enhance the user experience by offering optimized and context-aware suggestions.
